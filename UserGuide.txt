ZTypeWorld Instructions:

Words will begin to fall from the top of the screen and 
will try to come towards the ship. Your mission is to try 
erase all the words before they reach the ship. Use keys A-Z 
to get rid of the words. Letters will erase as you type them 
in order. Once you activate one word, you must fully erase 
that word before moving on to another. Good luck!
